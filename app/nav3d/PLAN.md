## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Navigation System for KPK-App requires significant enhancement to match the industrial aesthetic of a Mako Reactor facility while maintaining optimal performance across standard-issue Shinra terminals. The current implementation includes basic Three.js rendering but lacks the visual fidelity and stability required for Shinra operatives.

## PHASE 1: CORE STABILITY ENHANCEMENTS

### Priority 1: Eliminate Material Property Errors
- Replace inappropriate material property assignments (emissive properties on MeshBasicMaterial)
- Implement proper material selection based on rendering requirements
- Fix all console errors related to material configuration

### Priority 2: Asset Management
- Replace missing textures with locally stored alternatives
- Create a centralized texture loading system with error handling
- Implement fallback textures for any remote resources

### Priority 3: Performance Baseline
- Establish FPS monitoring
- Identify and eliminate memory leaks
- Optimize render loop for consistent performance

## PHASE 2: VISUAL FIDELITY UPGRADE

### Industrial Environment Enhancement
- Replace generic textures with industrial metal surfaces
- Add appropriate normal maps to enhance surface detail
- Implement proper metallic and roughness properties

### Lighting System Overhaul
- Replace basic lighting with proper industrial lighting
- Implement flickering effects for emergency lights
- Add subtle bloom effect to enhance light sources
- Create "Mako glow" for energy-related elements

### Portal Design Refinement
- Redesign portals with industrial door aesthetic
- Create proper arch detailing around portals
- Implement subtle particle effects for active portals
- Add mechanical sounds for portal activation

## PHASE 3: INTERACTION IMPROVEMENTS

### Movement Refinement
- Smooth out character movement with proper acceleration/deceleration
- Add footstep sounds based on surface type
- Implement better collision detection for environment objects
- Fine-tune camera follow behavior

### Room Transitions
- Create more dramatic room transition effects
- Add mechanical door opening/closing animations
- Implement proper loading states during transitions
- Add ambient sound changes between room types

### Navigation Enhancement
- Implement clearer visual indicators for interactive elements
- Add subtle highlighting for nearby portals
- Improve tooltips with more detailed information
- Create better visual distinction between room types

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & POLISH

### Mobile Performance
- Implement dynamic quality settings based on device capability
- Optimize texture sizes for mobile devices
- Reduce polygon count on distant objects
- Implement touch controls optimization

### Visual Polish
- Add subtle post-processing effects (ambient occlusion, antialiasing)
- Implement depth of field for distant objects
- Add subtle camera motion to enhance immersion
- Create proper "powered down" state for inactive areas

### Sound Design
- Implement ambient industrial sounds
- Add reactive audio to user interactions
- Create proper audio positioning for environmental sounds
- Implement audio occlusion based on environment geometry

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Core Principles
1. **Stability First**: Fix all errors before adding new features
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add features in layers that can be disabled on lower-end devices
3. **Asset Management**: Ensure all assets are properly stored and loaded with error handling
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance metrics throughout development

### Technical Approach
- Use native Three.js without excessive dependencies
- Implement proper error handling for all asset loading
- Create a clean separation between rendering and logic
- Document all major systems for future maintenance

### Aesthetic Guidelines
- Follow Final Fantasy VII industrial aesthetic
- Use appropriate color schemes (blue/green for Mako, red for warnings)
- Maintain consistent lighting model throughout
- Create appropriate contrast between interactive and non-interactive elements

## RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

### Code Refactoring
- Implement proper ES6 module structure
- Create a centralized asset loading system
- Establish proper scene management

### Asset Creation
- Industrial metal textures with normal maps
- Mako energy effect textures
- Industrial door models and textures
- Environmental sound effects
