## AESTHETIC PRESERVATION DIRECTIVE
*"The Lifestream's glow must persist, even in optimization."*

### Mako Ambiance Preservation Strategy
- **Current Aesthetic**: Ethereal green-blue glow with industrial undertones
- **Key Elements to Preserve**:
  - Dominant Mako green (0x66ffaa) color scheme
  - Atmospheric blue accent lighting
  - Portal glow effects
  - Industrial metal surfaces with reflective properties

### Optimized Lighting Approach
1. **Core Lighting Setup** (3 lights maximum)
  - One primary directional light (blue-tinted) for overall illumination
  - One strategic point light (Mako green) for central atmosphere
  - One movable point light that follows the character for dynamic lighting

2. **Material-Based Lighting**
  - Convert remaining point lights to emissive materials
  - Use MeshPhysicalMaterial with emissive maps for portal frames
  - Implement glowing edge effects using emissive intensity
  - Bake ambient occlusion into textures

3. **Efficient Glow Effects**
  - Replace individual portal lights with emissive materials
  - Use sprite-based glow textures for signage
  - Implement efficient bloom on mobile via selective rendering
  - Cache and reuse glow textures across similar elements

## CRITICAL PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Rendering Pipeline Inefficiencies
- **Current Issue**: Excessive use of lights (up to 8-10 per scene)
- **Impact**: Major GPU strain, especially on mobile
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduce point lights to maximum 3-4 per scene
  - Replace remaining lights with emissive materials
  - Implement light baking for static elements
  - Remove post-processing entirely

### 2. Geometry and Material Optimization
- **Current Issue**: High-poly count for decorative elements
- **Impact**: Unnecessary vertex processing
- **Solution**:
  - Merge static geometries using BufferGeometryUtils
  - Implement geometry instancing for repeated elements (pipes, gratings)
  - Reduce vertex count in non-essential decorative elements
  - Share materials across similar meshes

### 3. Texture Management
- **Current Issue**: Multiple unique textures with high resolution
- **Impact**: Excessive memory usage, slow loading
- **Solution**:
  - Create texture atlas for common elements
  - Reduce texture resolution for mobile devices
  - Implement progressive texture loading
  - Cache and reuse textures across rooms

### 4. DOM Element Overhead
- **Current Issue**: Excessive HTML overlays for portal labels
- **Impact**: DOM manipulation cost, layout thrashing
- **Solution**:
  - Replace HTML labels with sprite-based text
  - Implement object pooling for labels
  - Reduce update frequency for non-essential elements

### 5. Animation and Physics
- **Current Issue**: Per-frame collision checks and continuous raycasting
- **Impact**: CPU bottleneck on each frame
- **Solution**:
  - Implement spatial partitioning for collision detection
  - Reduce physics update frequency
  - Simplify collision geometries
  - Throttle non-essential raycasts

### 6. Scene Management
- **Current Issue**: Full scene rebuilding during room transitions
- **Impact**: Memory spikes, garbage collection stutters
- **Solution**:
  - Implement object pooling for common elements
  - Pre-load adjacent rooms
  - Optimize room transition logic
  - Cache room geometries

### 7. Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- **Current Issue**: Same quality settings across all devices
- **Impact**: Poor performance on low-end devices
- **Solution**:
  - Implement quality presets based on device capability
  - Reduce draw distance on mobile
  - Disable non-essential effects on low-end devices
  - Optimize touch input handling

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

1. **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**
   - Remove all post-processing
   - Reduce light count
   - Implement geometry merging
   - Optimize room transitions

2. **SHORT TERM**
   - Convert HTML overlays to sprites
   - Implement material sharing
   - Add device-based quality settings
   - Optimize collision detection

3. **MEDIUM TERM**
   - Create texture atlas
   - Implement object pooling
   - Add geometry instancing
   - Optimize scene graph

- **Memory**: < 256MB total usage
- **Loading**: Initial load < 3 seconds

### Monitoring Points
- Frame timing

## OPTIMIZATION VERIFICATION

1. **Testing Protocol**
   - Benchmark on reference low-end device
   - Monitor FPS over 5-minute sessions
   - Track memory usage patterns
   - Measure room transition times

2. **Success Criteria**
   - No frame drops below target FPS
   - Memory usage remains stable
   - Load times within target
   - Smooth room transitions

**Note**: Implementation of these optimizations should be done incrementally, with performance testing after each major change. Priority should be given to optimizations that provide the largest performance gains with the least development effort.
